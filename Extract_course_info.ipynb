In this course we will critically examine these assumptions and their consequences for scientific progress. In part 1 of the course we will examine how, in practice, researchers invoke at least three logically and conceptually distinct meanings of \\\"explanation:\\\" identification of causal mechanisms; ability to predict (account for variance in) some outcome; and ability to make subjective sense of something. In part 2 we will examine how and when these different meanings are invoked across a variety of domains, focusing on social science, history, business, and machine learning, and will explore how conflation of these distinct concepts may have created confusion about the goals of science and how we evaluate its progress. Finally , in part 3 we will discuss some related topics such as null hypothesis testing and the replication crisis. We will also discuss specific practices that could help researchers clarify exactly what they mean when they claim to have \\\"explained\\\" something, and how adoption of such practices may help social science be more useful and relevant to society.\",\"semester\":\"2023A\",\"num_sections\":1,\"course_quality\":null,\"instructor_quality\":null,\"difficulty\":null,\"work_required\":null,\"recommendation_score\":null},{\"id\":\"CIS-2400\",\"title\":\"Intro To Comp Systems\",\"description\":\"You know how to program, but do you know how computers really work?

Database constraint logics, temporal logics and description logics are successful compromises in this conflict: (1) they are expressive enough for practical specifications in certain areas, and (2) there exist interesting algorithms for the automated use of these specifications. Interesting connections can be made between these logics because temporal and description logics are modal logics, which in turn can be seen, as can database constraint logics, as certain fragments of first-order logic. These connections might benefit research in databases, computer-aided verification and AI.

We will examine how XML standards enable information exchange; how web services support cross-platform interoperability (and what their limitations are); how to build high-performance application servers; how \"cloud computing\" services work; how to perform Akamai-like content distribution; and how to provide transaction support in distributed environments. We will study techniques for locating machines, resources, and data (including directory systems, information retrieval indexing, ranking, and web search); and we will investigate how different architectures support scalability (and the issues they face). We will also examine ideas that have been proposed for tomorrow\\'s Web, and we will see some of the challenges, research directions, and potential pitfalls. An important goal of the course is not simply to discuss issues and solutions, but to provide hands-on experience with a substantial implementation project. This semester\\'s project will be a peer-to-peer implementation of a Googe-style search engine, including distributed, scalable crawling; indexing with ranking; and even PageRank. As a side-effect of the material of this course you will learn about some aspects of large-scale software development assimilating large APIs, thinking about modularity, reading other people\\'s code, managing versions, debugging, etc. Prerequisite: Familiarity with threads and concurrency, strong Java programming skills.',\n",

Each student will be responsible for presenting one primer and at least two SIGGRAPH papers to the class. Working in teams of two, students will design and develop an authoring tool that that facilitates the creation of a new type of user interaction, animation/simulation capability or 3D graphics special effect. Research papers published in the SigGraph Conference proceedings will provide the basis for the features/functionality/special effects that can be selected for implementation in the authoring tool. Each group will analyze the need and user requirements for the tool they plan to develop, prepare a formal software design document, construct a project work plan, develop the authoring tool functionality and user interface, test the design and demonstratthe authoring of associated content.

              "   'description': 'The objective of the game design practicum is to provide students with hands on experience designing and developing 3D computer games. Working in teams of three or four, students will brainstorm an original game concept, write a formal game design document then develop a fully functional prototype consisting of a playable level of the game. In addition to creation of original art and animation assets for the game, technical features to be designed and implemented include a nove l game mechanic and/or user interaction model, game physics (i.e. particle systems and rigid body dynamics), character animation, game AI (i.e. movement control, path planning, decision making, etc.), sound effects and effects and background music, 2D graphical user interface (GUI) design and optional multiplayer networking capabilities. Consistent with standard industry practices, game code and logic will be written using C++ and popular scripting languages such as Python and Lua. State-of-the-art game and physics engine middleware also will be used to expose students to commercial-grade software, production methodologies and art asset pipelines. As a result of their game development efforts, students will learn first hand about the creative process, design documentation, object-oriented software design and engineering, project management (including effective team collaboration and communication techniques), design iteration through user feedback and play-testing, and most importantly, what makes a game fun to play.',\n",

Rust derives from a rich history of languages to create a multi-paradigm (imperative/functional), low-level language that focuses on high-performance, zero-cost safety guarantee in concurrent programs. It has begun to gain traction in industry even before official 1.0 release in May 2015, showing a recognized need for a new low-level systems language. In this course, we will cover what makes Rust so unique and apply it to practic systems programming problems. Topics covered will include traits and generics; memory safety (move semantics, borrowing, and lifetimes); Rust\\'s rich macro system; closures; and concurrency. Evaluation is based on regular homework assignments as well as a final project and class participation.',\n",

In addition to creation of original art and animation assets for the game, technical features to be designed and implemented include a nove l game mechanic and/or user interaction model, game physics (i.e. particle systems and rigid body dynamics), character animation, game AI (i.e. movement control, path planning, decision making, etc.), sound effects and effects and background music, 2D graphical user interface (GUI) design and optional multiplayer networking capabilities. Consistent with standard industry practices, game code and logic will be written using C++ and popular scripting languages such as Python and Lua. State-of-the-art game and physics engine middleware also will be used to expose students to commercial-grade software, production methodologies and art asset pipelines.

What useful tools can machine learning develop from databases of art historical images or other datasets of visual culture? Can tools from machine learning help visual studies ask new questions? When put together, what can these fields teach us about visual learning, its pathways, its underlying assumptions, and the effects of its archives/datasets? Class project teams will ideally be composed of both humanities majors and engineering majors who will develop datasets and/or ask important questions of datasets, in addition to thinking and writing more generally about how computer vision could help in teaching and analyzing visual art. We are looking for a variety of students from different majors and schools to bring their diverse skill sets to the course. No programming knowledge is required. The course offers an example-based introduction to machine learning, so no prior knowledge of machine learning is required.',\n",

In this course we will critically examine these assumptions and their consequences for scientific progress. In part 1 of the course we will examine how, in practice, researchers invoke at least three logically and conceptually distinct meanings of \"explanation:\" identification of causal mechanisms; ability to predict (account for variance in) some outcome; and ability to make subjective sense of something. In part 2 we will examine how and when these different meanings are invoked across a variety of domains, focusing on social science, history, business, and machine learning, and will explore how conflation of these distinct concepts may have created confusion about the goals of science and how we evaluate its progress. Finally , in part 3 we will discuss some related topics such as null hypothesis testing and the replication crisis. We will also discuss specific practices that could help researchers clarify exactly what they mean when they claim to have \"explained\" something, and how adoption of such practices may help social science be more useful and relevant to society.',\n",

To enroll in CIS 410, students must develop an abstract of the proposed work, and a member of the CIS graduate group must certify that the work is suitable and agree to supervise the project; a second member must agree to serve as a reader. At the end of the first semester, students must submit an intermediate report; if the supervisor and reader accept it, they can enroll in CIS 411. At the end of the second semester, students must describe their results in a written thesis and must present them publicly, either in a talk at Penn or in a presentation at a conference or workshop. Grades are based on the quality of the research itself (which should ideally be published or at least of publishable quality), as well as on the quality of the thesis and the oral presentation. The latter are evaluated jointly by the supervisor and the reader. The Senior Thesis program is selective, and students are generally expected to have a GPA is in the top 10-20% to qualify.',\n",

Database constraint logics, temporal logics and description logics are successful compromises in this conflict: (1) they are expressive enough for practical specifications in certain areas, and (2) there exist interesting algorithms for the automated use of these specifications. Interesting connections can be made between these logics because temporal and description logics are modal logics, which in turn can be seen, as can database constraint logics, as certain fragments of first-order logic. These connections might benefit research in databases, computer-aided verification and AI. Discussion includes other interesting connections, eg., with SLD-resolution, with constraint satisfaction problems, with finite model theory and with automata theory.',\n",

A primary objective of the course is to enable students to integrate modern bioinformatics tools into their research activities. Course material is aimed to address biological questions using computational approaches and the analysis of data. A basic primer in programming and operating in a UNIX enviroment will be presented, and students will also be introduced to Python R, and tools for reproducible research. This course emphasizes direct, hands-on experience with applications to current biological research problems. Areas include DNA sequence alignment, genetic variation and analysis, motif discovery, study design for high-throughput sequencing RNA, and gene expression, single gene and whole-genome analysis, machine learning, and topics in systems biology. The relevant principles underlying methods used for analysis in these areas will be introduced and discussed at a level appropriate for biologists without a background in computer science. The course is not intended for computer science students who want to learn about biologically motivated algorithmic problems; BIOL 4536/BIOL 5536 and BE 5370/CIS 5370/MPHY 6090 are more appropriate.

Database constraint logics, temporal logics and description logics are successful compromises in this conflict: (1) they are expressive enough for practical specifications in certain areas, and (2) there exist interesting algorithms for the automated use of these specifications. Interesting connections can be made between these logics because temporal and description logics are modal logics, which in turn can be seen, as can database constraint logics, as certain fragments of first-order logic. These connections might benefit research in databases, computer-aided verification and AI. Discussion includes other interesting connections, eg., with SLD-resolution, with constraint satisfaction problems, with finite model theory and with automata theory.\", \"course_quality\": null, \"instructor_quality\": null, \"difficulty\": null, \"work_required\": null, \"course_number\": 6820, \"all_year\": \"2020,2021,2022\", \"season_Fall\": 1, \"season_Spring\": 0, \"season_Summer\": 0, \"keywords_yake\": [\"Computer Science\", \"Logics\", \"Friendly Logics\", \"description logics\", \"constraint logics\"]}]'"
